The public retrieval path is local and zero-provider: no reader, judge, provider

## Normalized Input

The CLI accepts one JSON object per query. A case contains:

- `source` and `group_id`, used for source-macro aggregation and grouped analysis;
- a query ID, namespace, text, frozen embedding, and released intent;
- all method-visible candidate memories, each with a stable ID, namespace, text,
  frozen embedding, released order, and lifecycle state;
- released query-memory policy decisions for content disclosure and operation-trace
  purposes; and
- scorer-only relevance, scope, policy, and lifecycle assessments.

The router never receives scorer assessments. Namespace support is computed from the
released namespace IDs. Policy is not a global `MemoryRecord` property: each case can
supply a `PolicyDecision` for the query-memory pair, and `QueryRecord.policy_purpose`
chooses content-disclosure or operation-trace authorization. This is still a released
metadata approximation, not a general policy engine. The released lifecycle arm can
observe these policy decisions plus released lifecycle and intent fields; ordinary
semantic arms do not use them.

Raw RHELM, MemOps, or GateMem payloads are not distributed here. The synthetic file
`tests/fixtures/retrieval_cases.jsonl` exercises the same normalized interface without
private data or benchmark redistribution.

## Candidate Construction

The frozen protocol records the source-specific construction rules:

1. RHELM groups are stable persona hashes. A query can see conversation turns in its
   split that occur strictly before the query date. Namespace arms then restrict this
   global support to the query persona.
2. MemOps groups are stable profile hashes. Every method-visible dialogue memory in
   the split enters global support. Namespace arms restrict support to the query
   profile. Released source order supplies the recency diagnostic because profiles do
   not share a cross-case wall clock.
3. There is no candidate subsampling and no positive injection.
4. Development and evaluation groups are disjoint. Evaluation settings are frozen
   before evaluation rows are processed.

## Embedding and Ranking Contract

The checked-in protocol identifies Qwen3-Embedding-8B and its exact revision. Inputs
use 4,096-dimensional float32 embeddings, a 512-token maximum, normalized last-token
pooling, and unit L2 normalization. Dense ranking is exact inner product. Equal scores
are resolved by ascending memory ID.

The public runner consumes frozen vectors rather than downloading or executing the
embedding model. This keeps retrieval deterministic and keeps model/provider access
outside the evaluator.

## Model Roles

The embedding encoder and downstream readers serve different experimental roles.
`Qwen/Qwen3-Embedding-8B` is the 8B retrieval encoder that produced the frozen
4,096-dimensional vectors. It is not asked to answer questions and is not compared
with the reader models as though they performed the same task.

The frozen controlled reader panel contains `gpt-5.6-sol` (OpenAI's Sol flagship,
reasoning `none`), `gemini-3.6-flash` (Google's production Flash speed/cost tier,
thinking `minimal`), and `deepseek-v4-pro` (DeepSeek's Pro tier, thinking disabled).
They are a deliberately heterogeneous cross-provider robustness panel, not a
same-tier capability leaderboard. Every estimate remains model-specific and models
are never pooled. Earlier GPT-4o and GPT-4o mini GateMem readers belong to a separate
observational audit and are not evidence from this controlled panel.

The optional `claude-opus-5` package is a separate fourth-reader replication. It uses
thinking disabled and medium effort for closer control alignment, cannot alter the
frozen three-reader outputs, and has no empirical result until a complete separately
authorized bundle is scored. It is not represented as Anthropic's current maximum
capability tier.

## Retrieval Arms

The frozen public evaluation contains nine selected arms, all returning at most
`top_k=100` memories. The two `*_only` arms added below are post-hoc attribution
diagnostics with no development tuning; they do not alter the frozen nine-arm run.

| Arm | Candidate support and score |
| --- | --- |
| `global_bm25` | All global candidates; standard BM25 with frozen `k1` and `b` |
| `global_dense` | All global candidates; exact inner product |
| `global_bm25_dense_rrf` | Global BM25 and dense ranks fused as `1/(k+r_bm25) + 1/(k+r_dense)` |
| `global_recency_dense` | Global dense score plus `gamma * normalized_released_order` |
| `namespace_dense` | Exact dense ranking after trusted namespace support restriction |
| `query_agnostic_current_only` | Deliberately misspecified ablation that removes released stale and superseded records for every query |
| `namespace_policy_only` | Namespace support plus query-memory policy filtering, without lifecycle filtering |
| `namespace_lifecycle_only` | Namespace support plus query-intent lifecycle filtering, without policy filtering |
| `released_intent_lifecycle_upper_bound` | Frozen historical v1 arm: namespace support; policy and lifecycle filters are both applied only to current-state queries, while history queries retain all namespace-local records |
| `released_governance_oracle_v2` | Corrected post-hoc v2 arm: namespace support; query-memory policy decisions apply to every query, while current-state queries additionally remove released stale and superseded records and history queries retain lifecycle states |
| `threshold_router` | Online namespace-local centroid assignment at cosine threshold `theta`; route to at most `top_l` qualifying clusters |
| `cluster_router` | Online namespace-local A5 centroid assignment and routing with size, cosine, and new-cluster scores |

The threshold router assigns a memory to the most similar existing centroid when its
cosine is at least `theta`; otherwise it creates a cluster. At query time it selects
at most `top_l` centroids meeting the same threshold.

For `cluster_router`, the existing- and new-cluster insertion scores are implemented
as:

```text
existing(k, x) = gamma * log(n_k + beta) + cosine(x, centroid_k) / tau
new(x)         = log(alpha_like) + (1 - max_cosine(x, centroid)) / tau_new
```

Query routing ranks existing clusters by the existing-cluster score and selects the
best `top_l`. Both clustered arms rank selected memories by exact dense similarity.
An empty clustered route falls back to namespace-local dense support, never global
support.

## Scoring

For each query, known usable memories are recall anchors. The scorer finds the
smallest ranking prefix reaching target recall `0.8`. Relevance and admissibility are
then scored separately on that same utility-matched prefix. Version 2 reports:

- non-usable exposure, which combines relevance and admissibility and is retained for
  compatibility with the frozen v1 experiment;
- admissibility violations alone, with their own known rate, label coverage, and
  lower/upper bounds;
- the four established relevance-by-admissibility cells: relevant/admissible,
  relevant/inadmissible, irrelevant/admissible, and irrelevant/inadmissible;
- joint relevance/admissibility label coverage;
- wrong-scope, policy-disallowed, and lifecycle-incompatible exposure rates;
- route width, candidates scored, and fallback status.

The four cell rates use the whole matched prefix as denominator. Items with unresolved
relevance or admissibility do not enter a known cell, and `joint_label_coverage` makes
that missing mass explicit. The unqualified legacy `contamination_*` Python properties
remain aliases of `non_usable_*`; new JSON output never labels them as pure
admissibility contamination.

An infeasible query receives risk `1.0` only in a penalized aggregate-risk quantity.
Conditional matched-prefix metrics remain undefined for infeasible queries. Queries
with no known usable anchors are recall-unevaluable and are excluded rather than
assigned zero. The two risk families are always named explicitly:

- `penalized_non_usable_upper_risk` is the historical v1 selection outcome and
  combines unresolved relevance with admissibility;
- `penalized_admissibility_upper_risk` is the v2 post-hoc governance outcome and
  excludes relevance-only failures from the conditional component.

Neither quantity is called unqualified "penalized conservative risk."

Every setting summary also decomposes each penalized upper risk into an
`infeasibility_risk_component` and a feasible-prefix conditional-risk contribution.
The identity is computed from query rows within each source before equal-weight
source aggregation. `conditional_*_upper_risk` is reported separately, so a lower
penalized score cannot be described as lower conditional contamination when the gain
actually comes from feasibility.

## Development Selection

Every candidate setting must cover the same source/query rows. The runner first
macro-averages queries within each source and then gives RHELM and MemOps equal
weight. The selection target is explicit in each protocol. It chooses one setting per
arm with this lexicographic objective:

1. maximize feasible rate;
2. minimize the selected penalized upper-bound risk;
3. minimize the corresponding penalized known-label risk;
4. maximize evidence recall;
5. minimize candidates scored; and
6. minimize stable setting ID.

The historical frozen v1 protocol records `selection_risk=non_usable_upper_bound`
because that is what selected the published settings; it is not retroactively renamed
as an admissibility-only result. Post-hoc v2 analyses reuse the frozen settings and
rankings and report `penalized_admissibility_upper_risk`; they do not claim that this
metric participated in development selection. New protocols may explicitly select
`admissibility_upper_bound`. The selected settings remain immutable evaluation inputs,
and the CLI does not tune or alter them during an evaluation run.

## Metadata Robustness

`robustness.py` changes method-visible metadata while preserving scorer assessments
byte-for-byte. Its deterministic, nested corruption channels cover:

- namespace false allows, false denies, missing labels, and label swaps;
- stale/superseded-to-current errors, current-to-stale errors, and missing lifecycle;
- policy false allows, false denies, and unknown decisions; and
- current/history intent flips.

Namespace swap, missing-label, false-deny, and lifecycle corruption is sampled once
per source-memory identity, so those record fields cannot change merely because
another query references them. Namespace false-allow is instead a query-memory gate
error and is sampled per source-query-memory identity, as are policy decisions;
intent corruption is sampled per source-query. Namespace swaps use one fixed
source-level vocabulary.

For a fixed seed and channel, cases corrupted at rate `r1` are a subset of those
corrupted at any larger rate `r2`. Retrieval settings never change along a curve. The
break-even utility reports the last contiguous observed rate where namespace dense
weakly dominates global dense on both feasible rate and penalized admissibility upper
risk, followed by the first observed non-dominating rate. It is a grid bracket, not an
interpolated population threshold.

The lifecycle rule remains a two-intent released-field approximation. It does not
claim that every stale record is valid for every historical question, and corruption
experiments do not turn it into temporal inference.

## Top-k Pareto Analysis

The Pareto runner produces each frozen ranking once at the maximum requested depth
and rescoring uses exact nested prefixes at `top_k` 5, 10, 20, 50, and 100. It reports
feasibility, non-usable and admissibility risk, returned memories, candidates scored,
and route width under identical ranking parameters. Candidate counts and returned
memories are algorithmic work measures. Local wall-clock observations are not eligible
for a deployment-latency claim.

## Paired Exposure Intervention

The zero-call exposure protocol reuses the 16 controlled governing scenarios and 32
paired queries, but supplies a purpose-built candidate overlay with explicit
relevance and admissibility labels. It does not infer relevance from the earlier
verifier's `stable_*` roles. For each query condition and candidate, one request
includes the candidate and the paired request omits only that candidate. The other
two candidates and query remain byte-identical.

The resulting 192 paired units form four construction-defined cells: 32
relevant-admissible, 32 relevant-inadmissible, 64 irrelevant-admissible, and 64
irrelevant-inadmissible. A frozen literal marker detects disclosure after Unicode,
case, punctuation, and whitespace normalization. Complete response bundles are
required; prefix scoring and output repair are forbidden. The primary contrast is
the exposure effect for relevant-admissible evidence minus the exposure effect for
relevant-inadmissible evidence, with whole-scenario bootstrap resampling stratified
by governing axis.

The checked-in CLI deliberately has no `execute` command and imports no provider
client. It can validate the protocol, materialize 384 provider-neutral requests per
reader, and score a separately supplied complete response bundle. No empirical
reader result or paid-call authorization is implied by this code path. A separate
provider runner is hash-bound to an execution amendment and remains unusable for paid
commands without an external exact-commit unlock. One separately authorized frozen
execution has completed; its content-free result package is
`results/counterfactual_exposure/`. That result does not add provider access to the
construction CLI or authorize a rerun.

The fixture is only a code-path smoke. It is not a benchmark result. Reproducing the
frozen natural-corpus run requires separately acquired public-source data and the
hash-bound source construction described in `PROVENANCE.md`.
