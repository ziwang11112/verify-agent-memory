# Provenance

This repository starts from an empty Git history. It is not a fork and does not
rewrite, replace, or supersede the source experiment history.

The migration snapshot is the source tree used to inspect and select artifacts. The
execution commit is the implementation revision recorded by the frozen natural-corpus
manifest. These identities are intentionally distinct.

The natural-corpus execution contains 33,903 route rows and 33,903 score rows for
3,767 queries. It recorded zero provider, reader, judge, and paid calls.

## Upstream Public Sources

The following identities were recorded in the frozen source audit:

| Source | Repository | Revision | Tree |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GateMem | `https://github.com/rzhub/GateMem.git` | `603f9f4b4ba4b77f043c20f85687fa016fd720b0` | `1cc06ce6dfcdaf2d34d631db094ef49d3e4d8a09` |
| RHELM | `https://github.com/microsoft/RHELM.git` | `726fc42ea0d5c11085c1a961ade10d702ba187d3` | `15bada413dc52f41177f5817563181243ed936d8` |
| MemOps | `https://github.com/MemTensor/MemOps.git` | `0b85a27bba856c287405a36e53a39e59e424c4e9` | `f9d5cf4ac3c600eecccfec008db4d487f961b5af` |

These identities do not establish redistribution permission for incorporated data.
The repository-level license audit is complete and recorded in
`docs/LICENSE_AUDIT.md`. Raw benchmark data remain excluded.

## Normalized Evidence

Phase 2 reads eligible aggregate artifacts only through
`git show a28093110325968c26906223e9eb0f1e078f6aad:<path>`. Every input is checked
against `SOURCE_ARTIFACTS.yaml` before parsing. Each normalized CSV is bound to its
source paths, source hashes, transformation script, and output hash in
`evidence/manifests/`.

The natural-evaluation importer additionally verifies the frozen execution
manifest: nine selected arms cover all 3,767 queries in both 33,903 route rows and
33,903 score rows, and provider, reader, judge, and paid-call counts are zero.

## Reader Executions

The two GateMem reader estimates are separate same-provider results:

| Reader | Provider | Execution commit | Response bundle SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18` | OpenAI | `b5d5e4cf49395b4079d16984b877af7b1abbc974` | `ebd2cdf942dff31ab5f8de42b460c6ceb88411babf7dcac724ebf9cc76cf22f2` |
| `gpt-4o-2024-08-06` | OpenAI | `a3d6814cff1f3c3927e473fb6573397e3205ee19` | `10aac8e7900f9498672f51f556f547b1620007c222418d020a78bbc0feeac99a` |

No raw response bundle is authorized for migration. The estimates must not be pooled
or described as a cross-provider replication.

## Controlled Prompt Executions

The paired-exposure evidence comes from two separately hash-bound executions over the
same constructed 16-scenario contract:

| Execution | Readers | Commit | Published manifest SHA-256 |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Original panel | `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gemini-3.6-flash`, `deepseek-v4-pro` | `82d3bce8023d1ccc97bb21b0bbb36e15a4b3c6af` | `a8574e39b2fa23a65491ead0329954251bd9cde51344330ee94e39e3c4afeda1` |
| Reader replication | `claude-opus-5` | `938320909b4c2d13e286987dc4297a7cb6ef73a7` | `b738a330efbf4072dbba30a1a5ff879072414523053e261ec58a52500eaa0963` |

Each reader completed 384 scored requests and one compatibility fixture. The original
panel and Claude replication are reported separately and never pooled. Their public
packages contain only content-free pair scores, aggregates, execution receipts, and
hashes; prompts, candidate text, answer text, and raw provider responses remain
excluded.

## Frozen Post-Hoc Controls

The support-control analysis is bound to natural execution commit
`8e34e3d41c56e1699696bc27be95cdac7c9528e5`, embedding checkpoint
`d333477116735f49b7628ee5d324e92a9f608190079a7b1d699308f5ec4f1ae6`, and the
route-bundle hashes listed in `results/support_controls/manifest.json`. It recomputes
exact rankings locally and makes zero provider calls.

The verifier operating curves are bound to complete OpenAI and Gemini structured
response hashes `fa25549ef10ce36408fc1c88312ab801ecd5ca0a447dac8f4a18f5ff0f8ec8ab`
and `b56bd3a1793334cbc0ff5ec75fb7b280ade5c143b13274ca0681da9dd1ce37db`.
Only aggregate curve points are released. The paired-exposure robustness calculation
uses the already public content-free pair-score hash
`855f98897b9e1963d98cd0d6da7ad043c93602febd8f3813583930b644572938`.
