# Migration Allowlist

This is a deny-by-default migration contract. Source paths are inspected only at
commit `a28093110325968c26906223e9eb0f1e078f6aad`. No file may be copied wholesale
before dependency, naming, license, and private-data review.

## PORT_AND_REFACTOR

The following files are candidates for logic-level porting. They must be rewritten
under the new package name, stripped of historical experiment names and routing
constants, and covered by new tests:

```text
bomi/eval/stage3_admissibility_metrics.py
bomi/eval/stage3_admissibility_runner.py
bomi/bench/stage3_memops_mapping.py
bomi/bench/stage3_rhelm_evidence_resolution.py
bomi/bench/stage3_natural_corpus_admissibility.py
bomi/bench/stage3_natural_dev_analysis.py  # selected analysis logic only
```

Required Phase 2 tests include complete method-by-query coverage, unresolved-label
bounds, rejection of `NaN` and infinity, and query-intent-sensitive lifecycle cases.
Because per-query route rows remain excluded, coverage is verified from the frozen
execution manifest: nine selected arms times 3,767 queries must equal both 33,903
route rows and 33,903 score rows.

## IMPORT_AS_FROZEN_AGGREGATE

Only the aggregate and manifest files enumerated in `SOURCE_ARTIFACTS.yaml` are
eligible. Phase 2 must:

1. verify the source SHA-256 against the read-only snapshot;
2. inspect for raw text, private content, identifiers, and license restrictions;
3. preserve the original source label and hash;
4. produce a deterministic normalized artifact with a new hash; and
5. keep the mechanism smoke separate from the full natural-corpus evaluation.

The eligible evidence families are:

- two separately executed GateMem reader aggregates and manifests;
- the 16-packet candidate-pool mechanism smoke; and
- the 87-group, 3,767-query public-source natural evaluation.

Raw response bundles and private scored derivatives are not eligible.

## REFERENCE_ONLY

Historical narrative, planning, and status documents may be read for source
interpretation but must not be copied into this repository. Their evidence status
is stale relative to the frozen full public-source evaluation.

## PROHIBITED

The following are outside the new repository's scientific and release scope:

```text
historical project branding and development timeline
Bayesian or nonparametric mixture implementations
novelty sidecars and retired indexing experiments
internal experiment and milestone numbering
owner-unlock and provider-recovery records
failed execution checkpoints
private responses and raw prompts
GPU embedding shards and route checkpoints
data/private/**
reports/**/cache/**
old status, agent-instruction, review-index, and README files
old .git directory and commit history
```

## Public Method Labels

Phase 2 may apply this mapping only through a deterministic transformation script.
The source file must retain its original hash, and the normalized output must receive
a new hash.

| Source label | Public label |
| --- | --- |
| `flat_dense` | `global_dense` |
| `namespace_dense` | `namespace_dense` |
| `ncr_threshold` | `threshold_router` |
| `ncr_a5` | `cluster_router` |
| `namespace_current_only` | `current_only_filter` |
| `namespace_source_intent_lifecycle` | `released_intent_lifecycle_upper_bound` |
| `flat_bm25_dense_rrf` | `hybrid_rrf` |
